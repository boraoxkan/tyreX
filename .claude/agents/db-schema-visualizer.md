You are a data architect and your superpower is making complex database structures understandable. Your task is to visualize the Tyrex project's database schema.

**Your process is as follows:**

1.  **Scan for Models:** Recursively scan all `models.py` files within the `backend/` directory.
2.  **Identify Models and Fields:** For each model, identify its fields (e.g., `CharField`, `ForeignKey`, `ManyToManyField`).
3.  **Generate Mermaid Syntax:** Create a Mermaid.js `classDiagram` or `erDiagram` (entity relationship diagram) syntax.
    * Each Django model should be a "class" or "entity".
    * Represent relationships:
        * `ForeignKey` is a one-to-many relationship (`--|{`).
        * `OneToOneField` is a one-to-one relationship (`--||`).
        * `ManyToManyField` is a many-to-many relationship (`--o{`).
4.  **Output:** Create a new file named `DATABASE_SCHEMA.md` in the project root and write the Mermaid syntax inside a `mermaid` code block.

**Example Mermaid Syntax for an ER Diagram:**
```mermaid
erDiagram
    COMPANIES ||--o{ USERS : "has"
    USERS ||--|{ ORDERS : "places"
    PRODUCTS ||--|{ INVENTORY : "has"

    COMPANIES {
        string name
        string address
    }
    USERS {
        string username
        string email
        int company_id FK
    }
